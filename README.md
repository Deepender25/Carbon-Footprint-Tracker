## üí° Potential Future Enhancements

*   **Backend Integration:** Implement a proper backend (e.g., Node.js/Express, Python/Django/Flask) for:
    *   Secure user authentication and accounts.
    *   Storing user data and footprint history.
*   **Data Visualization:** Display footprint data using charts (e.g., Chart.js) to track progress over time.
*   **More Granular Data:** Allow users to input more detailed activities (e.g., flight details, specific food items).
*   **Personalized Recommendations:** Offer tailored advice based on user's specific footprint sources.
*   **Gamification:** Add badges or points for reducing footprint.
*   **API for Emission Factors:** Fetch up-to-date emission factors from a reliable API.
*   **Progressive Web App (PWA):** Enable offline access and installability.
